# [StyleShell](http://styleshell.com)

StyleShell is Sass based lightweight css framework based on [Dave Gamache's](https://twitter.com/dhg) Skeleton Framework. It currently featues a stable version of StyleShell 1.0.0

-----

StyleShell is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://styleshell.com> for documentation and details.

### Contributions
The goal of StyleShell is to have a lightweit easily deployable and easily customised framework. In order to continue development of the original Skeleton framework, I can accept requests for any features or functionality outside the original implementation of [Dave Gamache's](https://twitter.com/dhg) [Skeleton Framework](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton). If you would like to see features, functionality, or extensions outside of the original please make a PR / or issue on the original skeleton framework.

If you have sass improvements, additional mixins, or other helpful sass techniques that stay within the original codebase. Feel free to make a pull request!

### Why it's awesome

StyleShell is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid and navigation bar. Nothing more.
- Minified, it's less than a kb
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- Easily customised


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
